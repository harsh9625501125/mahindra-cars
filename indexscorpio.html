<h1>The Mahindra Scorpio is a compact SUV manufactured by the Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra since 2002. It was Mahindra's first global model to be built for the global market.

The Scorpio was conceptualized and designed by the in-house integrated design and manufacturing team of Mahindra & Mahindra. The car has been the recipient of three Indian awards, including the "Car of the Year" award from Business Standard Motoring as well as the "Best SUV of the Year" and the "Best Car of the Year" awards, both from BBC World Wheels.The new Mahindra Scorpio SUV had all of its major systems designed directly by suppliers, with the only inputs from Mahindra being design, performance specifications and program cost. The design and engineering of the systems were carried out by suppliers, as well as testing, validation, and materials selection. Sourcing and engineering locations were also chosen by suppliers. The parts were later assembled in a Mahindra plant under the Mahindra badge, being a well-known brand in India. Using this method, the company was able to build from scratch a new vehicle with virtually 100 percent supplier involvement from concept to reality, at a cost of Rs 600 crore ($120 million), including improvements to the plant. The project took five years to move from concept to final product. The cost was estimated in 2002 to be Rs 550 crore.
